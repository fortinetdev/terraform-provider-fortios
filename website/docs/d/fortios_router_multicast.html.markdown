# Data Source: fortios_router_multicast
Use this data source to get information on fortios router multicast

## Argument Reference


* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the data source will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.


## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `route_threshold` - Generate warnings when the number of multicast routes exceeds this number, must not be greater than route-limit.
* `route_limit` - Maximum number of multicast routes.
* `multicast_routing` - Enable/disable IP multicast routing.
* `pim_sm_global` - PIM sparse-mode global settings. The structure of `pim_sm_global` block is documented below.
* `interface` - PIM interfaces. The structure of `interface` block is documented below.

The `pim_sm_global` block contains:

* `message_interval` - Period of time between sending periodic PIM join/prune messages in seconds (1 - 65535, default = 60).

* `accept_register_list` - Sources allowed to register packets with this Rendezvous Point (RP).
* `accept_source_list` - Sources allowed to send multicast traffic.
* `bsr_candidate` - Enable/disable allowing this router to become a bootstrap router (BSR).
* `bsr_interface` - Interface to advertise as candidate BSR.

* `cisco_register_checksum` - Checksum entire register packet(for old Cisco IOS compatibility).
* `cisco_register_checksum_group` - Cisco register checksum only these groups.
* `cisco_crp_prefix` - Enable/disable making candidate RP compatible with old Cisco IOS.
* `cisco_ignore_rp_set_priority` - Use only hash for RP selection (compatibility with old Cisco IOS).
* `register_rp_reachability` - Enable/disable check RP is reachable before registering packets.
* `register_source` - Override source address in register packets.
* `register_source_interface` - Override with primary interface address.
* `register_source_ip` - Override with local IP address.
