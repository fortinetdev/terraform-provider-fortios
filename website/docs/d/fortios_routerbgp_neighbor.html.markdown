# Data Source: fortios_routerbgp_neighbor
Use this data source to get information on an fortios routerbgp neighbor

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "fortios_routerbgp_neighbor" sample1 {
  ip = "21.1.1.12"
}

output output1 {
  value = data.fortios_routerbgp_neighbor.sample1
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `ip` - (Required) Specify the ip of the desired routerbgp neighbor.
* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the data source will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.
