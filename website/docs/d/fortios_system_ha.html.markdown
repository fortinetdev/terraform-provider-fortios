# Data Source: fortios_system_ha
Use this data source to get information on fortios system ha

## Argument Reference


* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the data source will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.


## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `group_id` - Cluster group ID  (0 - 255). Must be the same for all members.
* `group_name` - Cluster group name. Must be the same for all members.
* `mode` - HA mode. Must be the same for all members. FGSP requires standalone.
* `sync_packet_balance` - Enable/disable HA packet distribution to multiple CPUs.
* `password` - Cluster password. Must be the same for all members.
* `key` - key
* `hbdev` - Heartbeat interfaces. Must be the same for all members.
* `unicast_hb` - Enable/disable unicast heartbeat.
* `unicast_hb_peerip` - Unicast heartbeat peer IP.
* `unicast_hb_netmask` - Unicast heartbeat netmask.
* `session_sync_dev` - Offload session-sync process to kernel and sync sessions using connected interface(s) directly.
* `route_ttl` - TTL for primary unit routes (5 - 3600 sec). Increase to maintain active routes during failover.
* `route_wait` - Time to wait before sending new routes to the cluster (0 - 3600 sec).
* `route_hold` - Time to wait between routing table updates to the cluster (0 - 3600 sec).
* `multicast_ttl` - HA multicast TTL on master (5 - 3600 sec).
* `load_balance_all` - Enable to load balance TCP sessions. Disable to load balance proxy sessions only.
* `sync_config` - Enable/disable configuration synchronization.
* `encryption` - Enable/disable heartbeat message encryption.
* `authentication` - Enable/disable heartbeat message authentication.
* `hb_interval` - Time between sending heartbeat packets (1 - 20 (100*ms)). Increase to reduce false positives.
* `hb_lost_threshold` - Number of lost heartbeats to signal a failure (1 - 60). Increase to reduce false positives.
* `hello_holddown` - Time to wait before changing from hello to work state (5 - 300 sec).
* `gratuitous_arps` - Enable/disable gratuitous ARPs. Disable if link-failed-signal enabled.
* `arps` - Number of gratuitous ARPs (1 - 60). Lower to reduce traffic. Higher to reduce failover time.
* `arps_interval` - Time between gratuitous ARPs  (1 - 20 sec). Lower to reduce failover time. Higher to reduce traffic.
* `session_pickup` - Enable/disable session pickup. Enabling it can reduce session down time when fail over happens.
* `session_pickup_connectionless` - Enable/disable UDP and ICMP session sync.
* `session_pickup_expectation` - Enable/disable session helper expectation session sync for FGSP.
* `session_pickup_nat` - Enable/disable NAT session sync for FGSP.
* `session_pickup_delay` - Enable to sync sessions longer than 30 sec. Only longer lived sessions need to be synced.
* `link_failed_signal` - Enable to shut down all interfaces for 1 sec after a failover. Use if gratuitous ARPs do not update network.
* `uninterruptible_upgrade` - Enable to upgrade a cluster without blocking network traffic.
* `standalone_mgmt_vdom` - Enable/disable standalone management VDOM.
* `ha_mgmt_status` - Enable to reserve interfaces to manage individual cluster units.

* `ha_eth_type` - HA heartbeat packet Ethertype (4-digit hex).
* `hc_eth_type` - Transparent mode HA heartbeat packet Ethertype (4-digit hex).
* `l2ep_eth_type` - Telnet session HA heartbeat packet Ethertype (4-digit hex).
* `ha_uptime_diff_margin` - Normally you would only reduce this value for failover testing.
* `standalone_config_sync` - Enable/disable FGSP configuration synchronization.
* `logical_sn` - Enable/disable usage of the logical serial number.
* `vcluster2` - Enable/disable virtual cluster 2 for virtual clustering.
