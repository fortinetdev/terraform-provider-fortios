# Data Source: fortios_system_clustersync
Use this data source to get information on an fortios system clustersync

## Argument Reference

* `sync_id` - (Required) Specify the sync_id of the desired system clustersync.
* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the data source will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.


## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `sync_id` - Sync ID.
* `peervd` - VDOM that contains the session synchronization link interface on the peer unit. Usually both peers would have the same peervd.
* `peerip` - IP address of the interface on the peer unit that is used for the session synchronization link.
* `syncvd` - Sessions from these VDOMs are synchronized using this session synchronization configuration. The structure of `syncvd` block is documented below.
* `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` - List of interfaces to be turned down before session synchronization is complete. The structure of `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` block is documented below.
* `hb_interval` - Heartbeat interval (1 - 10 sec).
* `hb_lost_threshold` - Lost heartbeat threshold (1 - 10).
* `ipsec_tunnel_sync` - Enable/disable IPsec tunnel synchronization.
* `slave_add_ike_routes` - Enable/disable IKE route announcement on the backup unit.
* `session_sync_filter` - Add one or more filters if you only want to synchronize some sessions. Use the filter to configure the types of sessions to synchronize. The structure of `session_sync_filter` block is documented below.

The `syncvd` block contains:

* `name` - VDOM name.

The `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` block contains:

* `name` - Interface name.

The `session_sync_filter` block contains:

* `srcintf` - Only sessions from this interface are synchronized. You can only enter one interface name. To synchronize sessions for multiple source interfaces, add multiple filters.
* `dstintf` - Only sessions to this interface are synchronized. You can only enter one interface name. To synchronize sessions to multiple destination interfaces, add multiple filters.
* `srcaddr` - Only sessions from this IPv4 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions from multiple source addresses, add multiple filters.
* `dstaddr` - Only sessions to this IPv4 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions for multiple destination addresses, add multiple filters.
* `srcaddr6` - Only sessions from this IPv6 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions from multiple source addresses, add multiple filters.
* `dstaddr6` - Only sessions to this IPv6 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions for multiple destination addresses, add multiple filters.
* `custom_service` - Only sessions using these custom services are synchronized. Use source and destination port ranges to define these custome services. The structure of `custom_service` block is documented below.

The `custom_service` block contains:

* `id` - Custom service ID.
* `src_port_range` - Custom service source port range.
* `dst_port_range` - Custom service destination port range.
