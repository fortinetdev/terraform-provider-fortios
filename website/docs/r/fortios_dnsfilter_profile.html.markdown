* `external_ip_blocklist` - One or more external IP block lists. The structure of `external_ip_blocklist` block is documented below.
* `dns_translation` - DNS translation settings. The structure of `dns_translation` block is documented below.
* `dynamic_sort_subtable` - true or false, set this parameter to true when using dynamic for_each + toset to configure and sort sub-tables, please do not set this parameter when configuring static sub-tables.
* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the resource will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.

The `domain_filter` block supports:

* `domain_filter_table` - DNS domain filter table ID.

The `ftgd_dns` block supports:

* `options` - FortiGuard DNS filter options. Valid values: `error-allow`, `ftgd-disable`.
* `filters` - FortiGuard DNS domain filters. The structure of `filters` block is documented below.

The `filters` block supports:

The `external_ip_blocklist` block supports:

* `id` - ID.
* `addr_type` - DNS translation type (IPv4 or IPv6). Valid values: `ipv4`, `ipv6`.
* `src` - IPv4 address or subnet on the internal network to compare with the resolved address in DNS query replies. If the resolved address matches, the resolved address is substituted with dst.
* `dst` - IPv4 address or subnet on the external network to substitute for the resolved address in DNS query replies. Can be single IP address or subnet on the external network, but number of addresses must equal number of mapped IP addresses in src.
* `netmask` - If src and dst are subnets rather than single IP addresses, enter the netmask for both src and dst.
* `status` - Enable/disable this DNS translation entry. Valid values: `enable`, `disable`.
* `src6` - IPv6 address or subnet on the internal network to compare with the resolved address in DNS query replies. If the resolved address matches, the resolved address is substituted with dst6.
* `dst6` - IPv6 address or subnet on the external network to substitute for the resolved address in DNS query replies. Can be single IP address or subnet on the external network, but number of addresses must equal number of mapped IP addresses in src6.
* `prefix` - If src6 and dst6 are subnets rather than single IP addresses, enter the prefix for both src6 and dst6 (1 - 128, default = 128).
