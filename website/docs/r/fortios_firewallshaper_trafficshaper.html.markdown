# fortios_firewallshaper_trafficshaper
Configure shared traffic shaper.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fortios_firewallshaper_trafficshaper" "trname" {
  bandwidth_unit       = "kbps"
  diffserv             = "disable"
  diffservcode         = "000000"
  guaranteed_bandwidth = 0
  maximum_bandwidth    = 1024
  name                 = "trafficshaper1"
  per_policy           = "disable"
  priority             = "low"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - Traffic shaper name.
* `guaranteed_bandwidth` - Amount of bandwidth guaranteed for this shaper (0 - 16776000). Units depend on the bandwidth-unit setting.
* `maximum_bandwidth` - Upper bandwidth limit enforced by this shaper (0 - 16776000). 0 means no limit. Units depend on the bandwidth-unit setting.
* `bandwidth_unit` - Unit of measurement for guaranteed and maximum bandwidth for this shaper (Kbps, Mbps or Gbps). Valid values: `kbps`, `mbps`, `gbps`.
* `priority` - Higher priority traffic is more likely to be forwarded without delays and without compromising the guaranteed bandwidth. Valid values: `low`, `medium`, `high`.
* `per_policy` - Enable/disable applying a separate shaper for each policy. For example, if enabled the guaranteed bandwidth is applied separately for each policy. Valid values: `disable`, `enable`.
* `diffserv` - Enable/disable changing the DiffServ setting applied to traffic accepted by this shaper. Valid values: `enable`, `disable`.
* `diffservcode` - DiffServ setting to be applied to traffic accepted by this shaper.
* `dscp_marking_method` - Select DSCP marking method. Valid values: `multi-stage`, `static`.
* `exceed_bandwidth` - Exceed bandwidth used for DSCP multi-stage marking. Units depend on the bandwidth-unit setting.
* `exceed_dscp` - DSCP mark for traffic in [guaranteed-bandwidth, exceed-bandwidth].
* `maximum_dscp` - DSCP mark for traffic in [exceed-bandwidth, maximum-bandwidth].
* `overhead` - Per-packet size overhead used in rate computations.
* `exceed_class_id` - Class ID for traffic in [guaranteed-bandwidth, maximum-bandwidth].
* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the resource will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{name}}.
