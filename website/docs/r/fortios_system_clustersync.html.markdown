# fortios_system_clustersync
Configure FortiGate Session Life Support Protocol (FGSP) session synchronization.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fortios_system_clustersync" "trname" {
  hb_interval          = 3
  hb_lost_threshold    = 3
  peerip               = "1.1.1.1"
  peervd               = "root"
  slave_add_ike_routes = "enable"
  sync_id              = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `sync_id` - Sync ID.
* `peervd` - VDOM that contains the session synchronization link interface on the peer unit. Usually both peers would have the same peervd.
* `peerip` - IP address of the interface on the peer unit that is used for the session synchronization link.
* `syncvd` - Sessions from these VDOMs are synchronized using this session synchronization configuration. The structure of `syncvd` block is documented below.
* `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` - List of interfaces to be turned down before session synchronization is complete. The structure of `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` block is documented below.
* `hb_interval` - Heartbeat interval (1 - 10 sec).
* `hb_lost_threshold` - Lost heartbeat threshold (1 - 10).
* `ipsec_tunnel_sync` - Enable/disable IPsec tunnel synchronization. Valid values: `enable`, `disable`.
* `slave_add_ike_routes` - Enable/disable IKE route announcement on the backup unit. Valid values: `enable`, `disable`.
* `session_sync_filter` - Add one or more filters if you only want to synchronize some sessions. Use the filter to configure the types of sessions to synchronize. The structure of `session_sync_filter` block is documented below.
* `dynamic_sort_subtable` - true or false, set this parameter to true when using dynamic for_each + toset to configure and sort sub-tables, please do not set this parameter when configuring static sub-tables.
* `vdomparam` - Specifies the vdom to which the resource will be applied when the FortiGate unit is running in VDOM mode. Only one vdom can be specified. If you want to inherit the vdom configuration of the provider, please do not set this parameter.

The `syncvd` block supports:

* `name` - VDOM name.

The `down_intfs_before_sess_sync` block supports:

* `name` - Interface name.

The `session_sync_filter` block supports:

* `srcintf` - Only sessions from this interface are synchronized. You can only enter one interface name. To synchronize sessions for multiple source interfaces, add multiple filters.
* `dstintf` - Only sessions to this interface are synchronized. You can only enter one interface name. To synchronize sessions to multiple destination interfaces, add multiple filters.
* `srcaddr` - Only sessions from this IPv4 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions from multiple source addresses, add multiple filters.
* `dstaddr` - Only sessions to this IPv4 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions for multiple destination addresses, add multiple filters.
* `srcaddr6` - Only sessions from this IPv6 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions from multiple source addresses, add multiple filters.
* `dstaddr6` - Only sessions to this IPv6 address are synchronized. You can only enter one address. To synchronize sessions for multiple destination addresses, add multiple filters.
* `custom_service` - Only sessions using these custom services are synchronized. Use source and destination port ranges to define these custome services. The structure of `custom_service` block is documented below.

The `custom_service` block supports:

* `id` - Custom service ID.
* `src_port_range` - Custom service source port range.
* `dst_port_range` - Custom service destination port range.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all the above arguments, the following attributes are exported:
* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format {{sync_id}}.

## Import

System ClusterSync can be imported using any of these accepted formats:
```
$ export "FORTIOS_IMPORT_TABLE"="true"
$ terraform import fortios_system_clustersync.labelname {{sync_id}}
$ unset "FORTIOS_IMPORT_TABLE"
```
