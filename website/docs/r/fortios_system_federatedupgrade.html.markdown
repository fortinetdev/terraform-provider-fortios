* `known_ha_members` - Known members of the HA cluster. If a member is missing at upgrade time, the upgrade will be cancelled. The structure of `known_ha_members` block is documented below.
* `initial_version` - Firmware version when the upgrade was set up.
* `starter_admin` - Admin that started the upgrade.

* `dynamic_sort_subtable` - Sort sub-tables, please do not set this parameter when configuring static sub-tables. Options: [ false, true, natural, alphabetical ]. false: Default value, do not sort tables; true/natural: sort tables in natural order.
