* `override` - IPS override rule.

The `entries` block supports:

* `id` - Rule ID in IPS database (0 - 4294967295).
* `rule` - Identifies the predefined or custom IPS signatures to add to the sensor.
* `location` - Protect client or server traffic.
* `severity` - Relative severity of the signature, from info to critical. Log messages generated by the signature include the severity.
